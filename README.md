# factorio-bootstrap-bots

Bootstrap Bots lets you leverage blueprints and bots early in your game. The mod gives you at the start:

- 5 Blueprints
- 1 Deconstruction Planner
- 2 Personal Solar panels

And new items:
- 3 Bootstrap bots. A slow construction bot that keeps it's charge for longer.
- Personal Roboport MK0. A roboport with low range and max capacity of 3 bots.
- Colonisation gear. Weak armor with enough slots for the robotport and solar panels.

The mod also unlocks the Automated Construction technology so you can create more blueprints. There are no recipes for any of the new items, so don't lose them!

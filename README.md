# Bootstrap Bots

Bootstrap Bots lets you leverage blueprints and bots early in your game. The mod gives you at the start:

- 2 Personal Solar panels

And new items:
- 3 Bootstrap bots. A slow construction bot that keeps it's charge for longer.
- Personal Roboport MK0. A roboport with low range and max capacity of 3 bots.
- Colonisation gear. Weak armor with enough slots for the robotport and solar panels.

There are no recipes for any of the new items, so don't lose them!
